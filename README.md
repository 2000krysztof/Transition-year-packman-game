#Packman Ghosts

The goal of this excercise is to find the 4 ghosts and put them into jail.
* pinkey
* inkey
* dinkey
* clyde

You will see a jail folder and a few folders where the ghosts could be hiding

You will need to use these commands:
* cd: to navigate the files
* ls: to see what is in the directory
* mv: to move the ghosts to jail

hint: you can use mv <file name> ../ to move the file backwards in the directory.
